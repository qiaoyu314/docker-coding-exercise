## What
I am recently reading a book named "Single Page Web Application" by  Michael Mikowski and Josh Powell. It talks about how to make the web app faster by only render the necessary part of the web page instead of reloading the whole page when use takes some actions. Also, the tech stack used in this book is pure JavaScript, which is also neat.  

## Why
To be honest, I didn't use JavaScript much before. The more I touch this language, the more magic I find it has. Previously, JavaScript is known as low-performance and client-only language. Now, thanks to the improvement of JavaScript engine and framework like Node, JavaScript is more and more powerful. While JavaScript has some bad designs, I am sure it will be shown in more and more places in the future.
